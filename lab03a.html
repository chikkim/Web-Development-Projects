		<h3>Basic Info</h3>
		<p> Common Name: Dolphins</p>
		<p> Scientific Name: Odontoceti</p>
		<p> Size: up to 32 feet</p>
		<p>Weight: Up to 6 tons</p>
		<p> Dolphins are small-toothed cetaceans that are easily recognizable by their curved mouths,
		which gives them a permanent "smile." There are 36 dolphin species, found in every ocean. 
		Most dolphins are marine and live in the ocean or brackish waters along coastlines. 
		There are a few species, however, like the South Asian river dolphin 
		and the Amazon river dolphin, or boto, that live in freshwater streams and rivers.</p>

		<h3> Threat</h3>
		<p> For centuries, people have hunted dolphins for their meat and blubber. 
		Today, their main threat comes from being caught accidentally in commercial fishing nets. 
		Dolphins must rise regularly to the surface to breatheâ€”becoming 
		entangled in nets prevents this, leading to drowning. For maine 
		dolphins, warming ocean temperatures because of climate change have 
		caused some of their primary food sources to move into deeper, cooler water. 
		Furthermore, marine heatwaves, also caused by climate change, appear 
		to have a negative affect on dolphins' reproductive rates and ability to survive.</p>
		<p> In addition to hunting and entanglement in fishing gear, 
		freshwater dolphins face the additional threat of dams fragmenting and degrading habitat.</p>

	<h3> Argentina Selfie Dolphin</h3>
	<p>An endangered baby dolphin was killed on a beach in Argentina after the animal
	 was plucked from the water and passed around by beachgoers for petting and photos. </p>
	 <p> The incident, which took place at the beach resort town of Santa Teresita, 
	 has drawn wide condemnation from animal lovers and activists, including the 
	 Argentine Wildlife Foundation (AWF), which released a statement urging people 
	 to return dolphins encountered near the shore to ocean waters.</p>
	 <p> The main threat to dolphins is said to be fishing netts and dams.
	 But as it turns out curious swimmers and other beachgoers are also a top threat.
	 Video footage of the incident shows the animal being scooped up by a man and 
	 quickly surrounded by a curious mob eager to touch the animal. The
	  miniature dolphin, no more than a few feet long, is eventually left to 
	  die in the mud, where it can be seen lying motionless. At no point 
	  in the footage does it appear that anyone in the crowd intervened or 
	  attempted to return the animal to the water.
