		<h3>What is CSS</h3>
		<p>Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) is a language used to describe how 
		HTML elements are to be displayed on a web page or layout of HTML 
		documents like fonts, colors, margin, padding, height, width, background images, etc.
		There are three types of CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. </p>

		<h3> Bootstrap</h3>
		<p> Bootstrap is the most popular open-sourse front-end framework. It is
		a collection of CSS classes and JavaScript function and it is used 
		for responsive design and building responsive, mobile-first site and applicarion.
		It generallly works on a grid system for creating page layout with the help of rows and columns 
		and it supports all browsers for creating responsive websites.</p>

	<h3> Difference</h3>
	<p>The main difference between Bootstrap and CSS is that the BootStrap is a front-end framework
	while CSS is a style sheet language. Bootstrap provides a grid system which helps 
	witht he page laypout through a series of rows and columns. There is no Grid system in CSS.
	Bootstrap also contains already designed classes. The programmer can use them in their program 
	to add style without writing code from the beginning. On the other hand, in CSS, the programmer should 
	write the code from scratch.  Bootstrap comes with more features than CSS. It contains templates, 
	JQuery plugins etc. Bootstrap helps create more responsive designs that are more presentable while 
	CSS helps to create presentable webpages.
	 </p>
	 <p> I personally felt more comfortable to use CSS than bootstrap to create my website. There are 
	 extra features that come with bootstrap that makes it easier for us to create the website but, 
	 I am more used to CSS so I liked creating the the website using CSS more than bootstrap. Bootstrap is easier 
	 when it comes to making the website more responsive for other devices compared to CSS.
